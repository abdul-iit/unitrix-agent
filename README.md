# 🚀 Unitrix-Agent

**Android-Based Autonomous Cyber Intelligence Agent using Droidrun**

---

## 📌 Overview

**Unitrix-Agent** is an Android-based autonomous cyber-intelligence agent built using the **Droidrun agent framework**.
It automates wireless security monitoring workflows by controlling Android applications, collecting scan data, interpreting threat indicators, and generating actionable reports.

The project is designed for **defence research, cybersecurity R&D, and controlled simulation environments**, focusing on agentic automation rather than manual analysis.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Wireless security monitoring in defence and research environments is often manual, fragmented, and reactive.
There is a lack of Android-based autonomous agents that can continuously observe wireless activity, interpret intelligence signals, and respond intelligently without constant human intervention.

This limits scalability, increases response time, and reduces operational efficiency.

---

## 💡 Solution

Unitrix-Agent leverages **Droidrun’s Android automation capabilities** to act as an intelligent agent that:

* Automates Android-based scanning workflows
* Collects and processes wireless intelligence data
* Detects anomalies using rule-based agent logic
* Generates structured reports and alerts autonomously

The agent can integrate with the **Unitrix cyber-security platform** as a data source (hardware or simulated), enabling flexible experimentation and future expansion.
